### Project Title
Maze Solver

### Background and Overview
Maze will be randomly generated, will have options to use different algorithms to solve. Will show total steps and run time in ms.

### Functionality and MVP Features
- [ ] Randomly generate a maze
- [ ] User is able to navigate through maze using up/down/left/right arrow
- [ ] Will ask user to play again
- [ ] Have at least 2 algorithm solvers

### Architecture and Technologies
* JS
* CSS

### Implementation Timeline
 * Day 1
   * Finish wire frame
   * Submit proposal
 * Day 2
   * Generate random maze
 * Day 3
   * Create player
   * Allow player to control character by using up, down, left, right
   * Add in timer
 * Day 4
   * Add in ability to visualize Dijkstra algorithm on the maze
   * Add in game over screen / try again
 * Day 5
   * Add in ability to visualize A* algorithm on the maze
   * Style rest of the page with control keys, and how to play.
